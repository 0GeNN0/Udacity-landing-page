## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project by Udacity. 
* My work in this project was to create a dynamic ul by JS which includes a link for each section in the page 

## Explaning

* 1 - first I added section 4 with JS code

* 2 - I created a link for every section in the page by using the forEach method on the list of section 

* 3 - I created an eventListener for scrolling to highlite the section link when the section be in the View Port

* 4 - Finally i created a button to add a section when it clicked

### [ Note ]
* If you refresh the page the section that has been created by the button will be removed because I didn't store it in something like localStorage I just created it to add a feature and to make sure that every things work when changes happene
